# LexiKon is a free, open-source app to help you memorize vocabulary of a foreign language through fun exercises. The exercises are designed to help you get more familiar with the visual representation of the words in the foreign languages, and to help you memorize the translation from your 'source' language (e.g. your native tongue) to the 'target' language (the foreign language you're learning). This app is meant to be used as a (fun) supplement to standard language learning techniques and not as a standalone learning app, when learning a second (or third, or fourth) language as a teenager or as an adult.

# 

# You can upload any custom list of word pairs, or use a pre-defined one from https://github.com/svlandeg/lexivok.
