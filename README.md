LexiKon is a free, open-source app to help you memorize vocabulary of a foreign language through fun exercises. The exercises are designed to help you get more familiar with the visual representation of the words in the foreign languages, and to help you memorize the translation from your 'source' language (e.g. your native tongue) to the 'target' language (the foreign language you're learning). This app is meant to be used as a (fun) supplement to standard language learning techniques and not as a standalone learning app, when learning a second (or third, or fourth) language as a teenager or as an adult.

## üéâ Exercises

### Flashcards

The flashcards exercises presents you the 'source' word in the language you already know (e.g. your native tongue), and asks you to type the word of the target language you're learning. You can chose how many cards you want to get quized on, and the app will select a random subset of your vocabulary. At the end of the quiz, it will show you how many you got correct.
